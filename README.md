# SpaceX Falcon Project Description
This project aims to analyse SpaceX Falcon 9 launch success data. We seek to predict whether Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will land successfully based on various launch features, such payload mass, booster version, orbit and so on.

**FalconProject_DataCollectionSpaceXAPI.ipynb** collects the Falcon project data though SpaceX Rest API.
**FalconProject_DataCollectionWebscraping.ipynb** collects the Falcon project data through scraping the SpaceX wikipedia page for information on past launches.
**FalconProject_DataWrangling.ipynb cleans** and prepares the data for further analysis.
**FalconProject_EDAwithSQL.ipynb** uses MySQL to explore the Falcon data that we collected.
**FalconProject_EDA_Visualization.ipynb** visualizes and gets initial insights from the data.
**FalconProject_folium.ipynb** further visualizes various launch sites and corresponding success rates.
**FalconProject_Dash.ipynb** further visualizes the data by creating a dashboard application.
**FalconProject_PredictiveAnalysis.ipynb** performs predictive analytics to determine success/failure of Falcon 9 rocket's first stage.
